# Morning After: Late-Night Screen Time & Morning Alertness

## Overview
This project investigates how **evening screen use** affects **next-morning alertness**, independent of sleep duration. Using **63 days of self-tracked data**, the study examines:

- Sleep patterns
- Screen time by category (social media, entertainment, productivity)
- Morning alertness ratings

## Key Findings
- **Later screen use** predicts lower morning alertness (partial r = -0.937)
- **Social media use** has the strongest negative effect (r = -0.927)
- **Weekend alertness** is lower, reflecting “social jetlag”
- **Higher total screen time** leads to lower alertness in a dose-response pattern
- **Sleep duration** (7–9 hours) is not a significant predictor within this range

## Applications
- Optimize evening screen habits to improve morning alertness
- Inform digital hygiene and circadian-friendly routines
- Serve as a model for larger, multi-participant studies
