Morning After: Late-Night Screen Time & Morning Alertness

Overview

This project explores how evening screen use affects next-morning alertness, independent of sleep duration. Using 63 days of self-tracked data, the study analyzes sleep patterns, screen time by category (social media, entertainment, productivity), and morning alertness ratings.

Key Findings

Later screen use predicts lower morning alertness (partial r = -0.937)

Social media use has the strongest negative effect (r = -0.927)

Weekend alertness is lower, consistent with “social jetlag”

Higher total screen time reduces alertness in a clear dose-response pattern

Sleep duration (7–9 hrs) is not a significant predictor within this range

Applications

Optimize evening screen habits to improve morning alertness

Inform digital hygiene and circadian-friendly routines

Serve as a model for larger, multi-participant studies
